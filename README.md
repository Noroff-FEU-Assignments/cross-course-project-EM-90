In my module assignment (html & css) i used my new design. i made a new design because i wasent happy with my firs one i made. I used to much color 
in my first design, and it got really messy. The feel of the site did not relate to the target audience in the way i intended. i had to many useless
components, only for visual affects.

My new design looks profesional and it has less colors, colors that relate more to the target audience.
